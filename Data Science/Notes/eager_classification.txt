Eager learners construct a classification model based on the given training data before receiving data for classification.
It must be able to commit to a single hypothesis that covers the entire instance space. Due to the model construction,
eager learners take a long time for train and less time to predict.

Ex. Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Artificial Neural Networks
