- Android is the development of apps on phone.

- It uses JAVA programming language as a base for the coding, and the XML language for the design.

- To link the java file with the xml file we use the setContentView(R.Layout.#) in the OnCreate() function.

- Every component (called view) you use in your design can be linked to an object in the java code.

- To link we use the findViewById(R.id.#) function which takes an int as a parameter.

- The 'R' is the java file that is generated automatically by the pc and it contains all the resources of the app.

- 'R' contains manny inner classes whith each classs representing a file in the 'res' folder.

- ex:
     Button b = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);

- Casting to the needed object is necessary always and don't forget to give the view an Id ('button' here).

- Each android Activity (window) has a Life Cycle which organize the avtivity actions and so on.

- OnCreate(): your code goes here, it's the default function.

- OnStart(): this function is called after OnCreate().

- OnResume(): this function is called after OnStart() or OnPause.

- OnPause(): this function is called when the activity is not visible anymore and in the background.

- OnStop(): this function is called when the activity is exited.

- OnDestroy(): this function is called when activity is killed in the RAM.

- Remember to always put 'super.OnCreat()' at first before writing any code in any of the functions. 
                               .OnStart()
                               .etc
