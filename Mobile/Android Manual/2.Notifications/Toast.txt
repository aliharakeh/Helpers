- It's a kind of notification where a message will show up in a small popout usually at the bottom of the screen.

- Code:

       Toast.makeText(this, "#_msg", duration).show();

- this : is the context which is our class.

- "#_msg" : is the message shown in the popout.

- duration : can be one of these (Toast.LENGHT_LONG or Toast.LENGHT_SHORT).

- For a custom position u can do the following:

	Toast t = Toast.makeText(this, "#_msg", duration);
	t.setGravity(Gravity.TOP, x-pos, y-pos): x-pos: left(-), right(+) ; y-pos: up(-), down(+).
	                    .Center
	                    .etc...
	t.show();

- If you are using it inside an event handeler like the OnCLick event you need to change 'this' to 'getBaseContext()' or 'getApplicationContext()'.

- Also you can give it a custom layout by adding:

	LayoutInflater inflater = getLayoutInflater();
        // need a layout and give it an id.
	View viewLayout = inflater.inflate(R.layout.custom_toast, (ViewGroup)findViewById(R.id.custom_layout));
	t.setView(viewLayout);
