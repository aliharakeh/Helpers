- It's used to move between the activities of the app and to send data between them.

- Each intent has 3 properites: - action.
                                - category.
                                - data.

- To use an intent means that we have 2 or more activities and each one of them is linked to its own layout.xml file.

- Code:

         Intent i = new Intent(this, destination_activity_name.class);
         startActivity(i); // this starts the intent.

- And don't forget to declare your activity in the manifests.xml as follows:

         <activity android:name = ".activity_name" />
