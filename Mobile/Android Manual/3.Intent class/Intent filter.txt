- It's a kind of specification to destinguish between different activities.

- Where every activity has its own 'action name' that links to it.

- Or if 2 activities has same activity name, they can be differentiated by their category(ies).

- In Manifests.xml:

           <activity android:name = ".avtivity_name" >
                      <Inetent_filter>
                            <action android:name = "action_name" />
                            <category android:name = "category_name" /> // error if not included.
                      </Intetn_filter>
            </activity>

- The category helps organize the role of each activity by specifying it.

- To use them in the code:

                         Intent i = new Intent("action_name");
                         startActivity(i); // go to action_name's activity.

- And if 2 activities have the dame name then:

                         Intent i = new Intent("action_name");
                         i.addCategory("category_name"); // you can use it more than one time.
                         startActivity(i);
