- It's a timer with a 'Total time' and a 'Tick time'.

- No need to create an object of it, but you can if you want.

- Code:
         new CountDownTimer(int total_time, int interval_btw_ticks){
                @Override
                public void onTick(..){ // 1st_tick starts at 0 and the 2nd at 0 + interval.
                     // code here.
                }
                @Override
                public void onFinish(..){
                     // code here.
                }
         }.start();

- There are also some functions to cancel it
