- Plays #.mp3 file.

- It's prefered to declare it a global class variable, and to use the MediaPlayer.create() method
  together with the start() funcrion since if they are not and the stop() method was called the
  start() method won't play the sound file again.

- Syntax:
         MediaPlayer media_play = MediaPlayer(this, R.raw.mp3_name);
         media_play.start();
                   .stop();
                   .pause();
                   .etc..

- You can let the user select a sound file from the device by the following code.

- Code:
       // send and intent to let the user search for a sound file in the device.
       Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_GET_CONTENT);
                intent.setType("audio/*"); // specifying the data type to get.
                setResult(RESULT_OK);
                startActivityForResult(intent, 0); // '0' is the request id you give to the intent.
      
      // receive the data and start playing the sound file
      @Override
      protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        // make sure you are receving the correct intent. 
        if(resultCode == RESULT_OK && requestCode == 0){
            if(mediaPlayer.isPlaying())
                mediaPlayer.stop();
            try{
                mediaPlayer = MediaPlayer.create(context, Uri.parse(data.getDataString()));
                mediaPlayer.start();
            }
            catch (Exception e){
                Toast.makeText(this, "error", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        }
    }
