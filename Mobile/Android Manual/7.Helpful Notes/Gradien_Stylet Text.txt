- To use a gradient style on the textview text use:
- This is one of the Two constructors of the LinearGradient class, use ctrl+space to see the 2nd, but they are kinda the same

text_view.getPaint().setShader(new LinearGradient(0,0,0,0,
                                                  Color.BLUE,
                                                  Color.CYAN,
                                                  Shader.TileMode.CLAMP));

- It takes 7 parameters:

  - float x,y,x1,y1 -> x,y = start line , x1,y1 = end line
 
  - 1st color.

  - 2nd color.

  - mode -> REPEAT or CLAMP or MIRROR.
