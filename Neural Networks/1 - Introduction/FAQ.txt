1 - Role of optimizers:
-----------------------
    - find the min of a curve/function

2 - Softmax activision:
-----------------------
    - represent categorical distribution (k different outcomes - nb of categories)
    
3 - Dense layer:
----------------
    - a fully connected layer where each input is connected to all outputs
    
4 - Sparse categorical crossentropy loss function:
--------------------------------------------------
    - for cases where we have more than 2 categories to represent each category or class as an int 0 -> n-1 (n is number of categories)
    - whithout sparse keyword we get a binary representaion instead ex: [1, 0, 0] (3 categories and this example belongs to category 1)
    
5 - epoches:
------------
    - low value ==> overfitting of model (training = good result, testing = bad result)
    - medium value ==> optimum (training = good result, testing = good result)
    - high value ==> underfitting (training = bad result, testing = bad result)
    
6 - why do we need optiomizers:
-------------------------------
    - it's what updates our model's weights according to the result from the loss function
    
7 - Dropout:
------------
    - droping random nodes from a layer to avoid overfitting the model
    
8 - in case of overfitting:
---------------------------
    - use regularization to fix your model (dropout, L2 regularization)

8 - in case of underfitting:
---------------------------
    - add more layers or more parameters
    
10 - Batch size:
---------------
    - according to your machine processing power
    - there is no specific number, you need to test with it
    
11 - Convolutional Network:
---------------------------
    - each filter can detect some specific feature
    - the more layers with other filters the more complex the model becomes and the more patterns it can detect
    - it is common to see a conv layer followed by a pooling layer and at the end there are some fully connected layers (dense layers)
      taht are connected to a softmax output layer.

12 - Flatten Layer:
-------------------
    - converts the input into a vector (dimension 1xn) which can be then used by a dense layer (fully connected layer)
