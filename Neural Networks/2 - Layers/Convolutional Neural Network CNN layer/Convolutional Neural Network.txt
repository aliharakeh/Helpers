- it differentiate to multi layered perceptron (MLP) in its hidden layers
- all depends in the convolutional hidden layers
- each conv layer has filters that detects patterns
- a pattern can be an edge, circle, square, ...etc
- later layers can detect more sophisticated objects like cats, dogs
- a filter is a small matrix, ex:3x3
- this filter is then scanned accros the input image => convolving
- lets say we took a filter of 3x3 of random numbers, then we will now scan the input image and save the dot product of the filter and the scaned 3x3 matrix from the input image to get our new pixels in the output
- take note that if uyou take a 3x3 filter then first scan will give col 1,2,3 from the input image and the next step will use col 2,3,4 so you will only be moving a column at a time
- this output will be the new input for the next layer
- you can have more than one filter
- more conv layers ==> more filters ==> more complex model ==> more complex pattern detection ==> better results
