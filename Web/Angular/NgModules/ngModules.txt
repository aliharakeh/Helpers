Angular Modules:
----------------
    declarations:
    ------------
		Used When:
		----------
			- you need to tell angular that you created something 
			- it's like saying "yo angular, check this sexy component that I made"
			
		
		Used For:
		---------
			- components/directives/pipes that we want to export (to be used in other components - called public components/directives/pipes)
			- sub-components
			- any components/directives/pipes should be declared somewhere once
		

    imports:
    --------
		Used When:
		----------
			- you need external dependencies
			- you are too lazy like me and use external libraries
			- you are a neat freak and can't bare having too many stuff in your module so you group them by their category and then group them even more
			
			
		Used For:
		---------
			- modules that export components/directives/pipes which you need in your current module
			- modules that provide some services you need in your current module
		

    providers:
    ----------
		Used When:
		----------
			- want to provide a service through this module
			- service lifetime depends on module's lifetime
			- a service that is only availble when you load this module
			- you want to have more stuff in your module than other modules just so you can feel more superior (pretty sad indeed)
		
		
		Used For:
		---------
			- services
			- interceptors
			- injectors & injectors' Tokens
		

    exports:
    --------
		Used When:
		----------
			- you want to share your stuff with the world
			- you are a good person who beleives in the "sharing is caring" quote (i.e: The Big Hearted Guy/Girl/Apache Helicopter)
		
		
		Used For:
		---------
			- components/directives/pipes that we want to export (to be used in other components - called public components/directives/pipes)
			- modules that we imported and want to re-export them (to group them in one module or for whatever other reason)
		

    bootstraps:
    -----------
		Used When:
		----------
			- you want to... it just exists
			- don't use bootrap.css, tailwind.css is better :)
			
		
		Used For:
		---------
			- components that are the root of the components tree (an app usually has 1 components tree but there can be more - idk why though, yet!)


    Extra:
    ------
        - you can group components/modules with declarations/imports and then export/re-export them as a group (Shared NgModule)
        - you can declare components and sub-components then just export the root component (only root component is public - Domain NgModule)
        - you can just import modules that exports components you need in your component when your component is served by the router module 
          (no need for declarations or exports - Routed NgModule)
