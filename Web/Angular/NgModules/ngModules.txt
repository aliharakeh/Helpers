Angular Modules:
----------------
    declarations:
    ------------
        - components/directives/pipes that we want to export (to be used in other components - called public components/directives/pipes)
        - sub-components
		- any components/directives/pipes should be declared somewhere once

    imports:
    --------
        - modules that export components/directives/pipes which you need in your current module
        - modules that provide some services you need in your current module

    provider:
    ---------
        - services
        - interceptors
        - injectors & injectors' Tokens

    exports:
    --------
        - components/directives/pipes that we want to export (to be used in other components - called public components/directives/pipes)
        - modules that we imported and want to re-export them (to group them in one module or for whatever other reason)

    bootstraps:
    -----------
        - components that are the root of the components tree (an app usually has 1 components tree but there can be more - idk why though, yet!)


    Extra:
    ------
        - you can group components/modules with declarations/imports and then export/re-export them as a group (Shared NgModule)
        - you can declare components and sub-components then just export the root component (only root component is public - Domain NgModule)
        - you can just import modules that exports components you need in your component when your component is served by the router module 
          (no need for declarations or exports - Routed NgModule)
