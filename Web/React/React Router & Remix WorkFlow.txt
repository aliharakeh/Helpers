React Router v6 & Remix:
------------------------
- Normal Work-Flow
------------------
	- work as if you are doing a multi-page app 
	- forms
	- CRUD nested routes (/add, /:id, /delete, ...)
	- action redirects
	- navigation to parent route (closing modal, back button, ...)
	- use url params to select and show specific list item details on page (list items details, ...)

- Fetcher Work-Flow:
--------------------
	- when no redirection is needed (ex: delete operation)
	- synchronize uncontrolled inputs with props again inside useEffect() (when using ref instead of setState for input control)
